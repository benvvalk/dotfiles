These files are copied from commit `c2f2f68` of my
`git@github.com:benvvalk/dired-hacks.git` repo (`dired-narrow-fixes`
branch).

This version of `dired-narrow.el` contains a couple of my own bug fixes
that: (1) make `dired-narrow` work correctly with `hl-line-mode`, and
(2) prevent unwanted cursor movements in the dired buffer while the
user is editing the filter in the minibuffer.

`dired-hacks-utils.el` is identical to the original file from
the `dired-hacks` repo.
