# Note: I disable syncing of the drafts folder with !"[Gmail]/Drafts"
# to avoid a bad interaction between mu4e and mbsync, which causes
# an unbounded number draft files to be created in the drafts folder
# while composing a message in emacs [1].
#
# The downsides of not synchronizing the drafts folder
# are that: (1) I cannot start composing a draft on machine A
# and then resume editing the draft on machine B, and (2) my drafts
# don't get backed up to gmail. I think I can live with those
# caveats, though.
